# Meaningless [C]ode

This project translates English text using logical rules. More rules will be added over time.

## Why?

Before diving into machine languages, I enjoyed learning spoken languages conversationally. This process often highlights the quirks and inconsistencies of English. This project is inspired by features from other languages, such as:

- Characters from Icelandic
- Lack of conjugation from Thai
- Phonemic words from Hindi

It may eventually evolve into a list of my grievances with English.

## Why Rust?

I thought it'd be fun.

## How does it sound?

The output should sound mostly the same as standard English. If you can speak English, you'll be able to read and write this modified version.

## What are some of the conventions / rules / changes?

1. English is written phonetically, with few exceptions.
2. The English alphabet was historically reduced due to technological limitations of the printing press. Since this is no longer an issue, some of the missing characters are added, while others are removed as redundant.
3. Letters have only one sound. There are no variations like "c" in "cat" and "city".
