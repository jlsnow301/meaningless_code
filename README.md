# Meaningless [C]ode

This project translates English text using logical rules. More rules will be added over time.

## Why?

Before diving into machine languages, I enjoyed learning spoken languages conversationally. This process often highlights the inconsistencies of English. This project has become essentially a laundry list of grievances against the English language, drawing heavy influence from IPA and eventually planning to implement features of other languages, such as lack of conjugation from Thai.

## Why Rust?

I thought it'd be fun.

## How does it sound?

The output should sound mostly the same as standard English. If you can speak English, you'll be able to read and write this modified version.

## I don't want to remember the rules!

You already know them! In fact, you're already remembering a metric ton of obscure rules for English. How do you pronounce "phone"? Where is the p, h, or e? Here is how the word is spelled using this project: fon.

## What are some of the conventions / rules / changes?

1. English is written phonetically, with few exceptions.
2. The English alphabet was historically reduced due to technological limitations of the printing press. Since this is no longer an issue, some of the missing characters are added.
3. Some letters are removed as redundant, such as 'k' and later "q".
4. Letters have only one sound. There are no variations like "c" in "cat" and "city".
5. Unlike IPA, English vowels are intended to sound just as the letter, such as the "e" in "deed".
6. In most cases, vowels are not combined to create new sounds. For instance, "look" uses two o's to prodocue the "ʊ" sound, so look becomes _lʊk_.
7. Also unlike IPA, compound consonants do not need to become a new letter so long as they are present in the pronunciation of the word. The "sh" in "shadow" does not need to become "ʃadow". However, the "th" in "thought" _does_ become "ð" because neither t nor h make that sound!
