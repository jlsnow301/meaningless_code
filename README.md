# Meaningless [C]ode

This project translates English text using logical rules. More rules will be added over time.

## Why?

Before diving into machine languages, I enjoyed learning spoken languages conversationally. This process often highlights the quirks and inconsistencies of English. This project is inspired by features from other languages, such as:

- Characters from Icelandic
- Lack of conjugation from Thai
- Phonemic words from Hindi

It may eventually evolve into a list of my grievances with English.

## Why Rust?

I thought it'd be fun.

## How does it sound?

The output should sound mostly the same as standard English. If you can speak English, you'll be able to read and write this modified version.

## I don't want to remember the rules!

You already know them! In fact, you're already remembering a metric ton of obscure rules for English. How do you pronounce "phone"? Where is the p, h, or e? Here is how the word is spelled using this project: fon.

## What are some of the conventions / rules / changes?

1. English is written phonetically, with few exceptions.
2. The English alphabet was historically reduced due to technological limitations of the printing press. Since this is no longer an issue, some of the missing characters are added.
3. Some letters are removed as redundant, such as 'k' and later "q".
4. Letters have only one sound. There are no variations like "c" in "cat" and "city".

## Some quirks

1. Compound consonants. The "sh" in "shadow" does not need to become "ʃadow". However, the "th" in "thought" _does_ become "ð" because neither t nor h make that sound!
2. Compound vowels. In most cases, vowels are not combined. English tends to use compound vowels in order to pronounce letters which are not in the alphabet. For instance, "look" uses two o's to produce the "ʊ" sound.
