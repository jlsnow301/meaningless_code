### All current vowels are used as long vowels. They sound just like the letter

Examples: 'a' as in "fate", 'e' as in "feet", 'i' as in "kite", 'o' as in "note", 'u' as in "cute"

long_vowels = [ 'a'; 'e'; 'i'; 'o'; 'u' ]

### Short vowels are separated from the standard vowels.

Examples: "æ" as in "cat", "ɛ" as in "bed", "ɪ" as in "sit", "ɒ" as in "hot", "ʌ" as in "cut", "ʊ" as in "put"

short_vowels = [ "æ"; "ɛ"; "ɪ"; "ɒ"; "ʌ"; "ʊ" ]
